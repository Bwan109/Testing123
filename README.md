## Automate SonarQube with Github Actions for ASP.NET WebForms 


#### **Pre Requirements**: 
- Identify the written programming language of the source codes. 
- Ensure source codes are uploaded on a Github Repository.
- Ensure it is able to access (sonarq.uemedgenta.com) website and Login. 

#### **Steps:**
1) Access SonarQube Website. And Login
2) Create new project manually 
3) Configure Github Actions for SonarQube
4) Creating Secrets in Github Repo

7) Navigate Set up a workflow yourself 
8) Update the existing workflow code with the Github Actions code generated by SonarQube
9) Setup MsBuild for ASP.NET project (Tech COE to document steps to setup MsBuild for reference by other ASP.NET projects)

#### HOORAY Well Done!!!! You have successfully Automated SonarQube Code scanning with Github Actions.
